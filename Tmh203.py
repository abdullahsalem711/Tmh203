#The law provided several explanations for many phenomena that occur at the level of the universe and at the level of celestial bodies and planets in various galaxies with their differences. Among the explanations given and presented by this law are the following:
 #Provide an explanation of the rotational pattern that occurs between planets, stars and supernovae that are on the verge of extinction and disintegration. 
#Presenting the law for a complete explanation of the columbian attraction that occurs at the level of atomic nuclei and at the level of atomic molecules.
